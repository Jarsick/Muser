# Muser
**Muser is a procedural music generator.**  
It gives you a GUI to set parameters (or randomize them) to customize the song generation.  
A preview of the song can be heard by this GUI, and it can be exported on a MIDI File.  
The MIDI export is intended to be edited by other programs. Not to be used as is.
